# Contributing to RockNSM

We're super glad to have you helping out with the project. Before you submit code, it's important to understand that this entire project is licensed according to the contents of [LICENSE](./LICENSE). This includes any code that you commit. We created this project to do good in the NSM community. I know for a fact that more than one commercial company leverages this work in their products and services. What's important to me is that you or I could do the same thing and make the world of cyber a safer place. I hope that if you do leverage this work for your commerical or corporate ventures, you can contribute back to the community by way of filing issues, creating documentation, or fixing bugs.

## QUESTIONS ?

We're just a handful of developers and engineers and probably need better communication mediums. For now, if you have questions, head over to the docs on http://rocknsm.io/ and see if that helps. If you still need help, visit our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rocknsm) at Google Groups. If you think you found a bug, please file an issue - better yet, submit a patch!

The GitHub issue tracker is not the best place for questions for various reasons, but both the docs and the mailing list are very helpful places for those things.

## Contributing ?
Please see the [CODING_GUIDELINES](./CODING_GUIDELINES.md) for information on style and general processes for contributing to this project.

### Pull Requests
Please make pull requests against the `devel` branch. When submitting them, try to follow the style documented in the `CODING_GUIDELINES` and run it through `ansible-lint` first. It doesn't have to be perfect, and eventually we can do that in an automated fashion, but we're not there quite yet. If you have expertise in CI/CD, we'd love your contributions!

## Bug to report ?
You can report bugs or make enhancement requests at the RockNSM GitHub [issue page](https://github.com/rocknsm/rock/issues/) by filling out the issue template that will be presented.

Also please make sure you are testing on the latest released version of RockNSM or the development branch (`devel`).
