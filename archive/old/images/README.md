The png images were designed and created using https://www.draw.io/. You can import the images from your local drive. You can also export the diagrams as png images that includes a copy of the diagram (you must check this) so you can edit them later on www.draw.io. This is perfect for being able to edit the image on Github and save the image on Github and still be able to use the same system for editing it without having to track multiple files and ensure they stay synchronized
