= Configuration

Edit `/etc/rocknsm/config.yml` to suit your needs. For simple all-in-one installs, the main points to configure are 

```
sudo vim /etc/rocknsm/config.yml
```

Generally, most of the options you'll want to change are near the top. The file is fairly well commented. The defaults are auto-generated according to our best guess at your hardware with some simple rules of thumb. That said, you could consider tweaking them according to your performance needs.

[options="header"]
|===
| Name | Default | Description

| rock_monifs
| `[eno3, eno4]`
| These interfaces will be configured in Bro, Suricata, Stenographer and our tuning script for passive collection. The default is actually auto-detected from your hardware. It defaults to selecting all ethernet interfaces on the system that are not the default gateway (i.e. the management interface).

| rock_hostname
| `simplerockbuild`
| This will be used in all places where the hostname is needed. It will also be placed in `/etc/hosts`

| rock_fqdn
| `simplerockbuild.simplerock.lan`
| This will be set in `/etc/hosts` to provide FQDN lookup within the sensor

| bro_cpu
| Half of available cores, not to exceed 8
| This will allocate this many CPUs to bro as worker nodes

| es_cluster_name
| `rocknsm`
| Elasticsearch will be configured to use this as the cluster name.

| es_node_name
| _rock_hostname_
| This will appear in Elasticsearch runtime information as the node name.

| es_mem
| Half of available memory, rounded down to the nearest gigabyte
| This is used to configure the heap size for Elasticsearch.

| pulled_pork_oinkcode
| an oinkcode that we registered
| If you pulled snort rules from snort.org, you should replace this with your own code. This is used to uniquely identify a user for purposes of rate-limiting. If you use the same one that every install of ROCK uses, you will be rate limited or denied.

| rock_online_install 
| `True` (unless installed from ISO)
| Configures yum and other downloads to pull packages from the Internet. If this is set to `False`, you should have already followed to procedures to make an <<working-offline,Offline Snapshot>>

| epel_baseurl
| _the default url for EPEL_
| You can change this to point to a local yum mirror for EPEL if you have one.

| epel_gpgurl
| _the default url for the EPEL gpg key
| You should change this if your sensor cannot reach the Internet and you have a copy of the EPEL GPG Key on your internal package mirror

| elastic_baseurl
| _the upstream Elastic yum repository_ 
| You can change this to point to a local yum mirror for Elastic if you have one

| elastic_gpgurl
| _the default url for the Elastic GPG key_ 
| You should change this if your sensor cannot reach the Internet and you have a copy of the Elastic GPG Key on your internal package mirror

| rocknsm_baseurl
| _the online rocknsm repo_
| You can change this to point to a local yum mirror for ROCK NSM packages if you have one 

| rocknsm_gpgurl
| _the default url for the ROCK NSM key_ 
| You should change this if your sensor cannot reach the Internet and you have a copy of the ROCK NSM GPG Key on your internal package mirror

| rocknsm_local_baseurl
| `/srv/rocknsm`
| This is the location for a local offline yum repository and a local file cache for file archives used during the deployment. Even when installing online this is used to store downloaded files.

| bro_rockscripts_repo
| _our github repo for bro scripts_
| You could change this to your own fork of our bro scripts or a local git repository.

| pulled_pork_repo
| https://github.com/shirkdog/pulledpork.git
| You could change this to your own fork of pulled pork or to a local git repository.

| included_components.stenographer.enabled 
| `True`
| Determines whether Stenographer will be installed as the PCAP capture engine.

| included_components.bro.enabled
| `True`
| Determines whether Bro will be installed and configured.

| included_components.suricata.enabled
| `True`
| Determines whether Suricata will be installed and configured. 

*NOTE*: While you theoretically _could_ install both Suricata and Snort, I guarantee that the automated deployment will not configure this as you were hoping.

| included_components.fsf.enabled
| `True`
| Determines whether FSF will be installed and configured.

| included_components.snort.enabled
| `False`
| Determines whether Snort will be installed and configured.

*NOTE*: While you theoretically _could_ install both Snort and Suricata, I guarantee that the automated deployment will not configure this as you were hoping.

| included_components.pulledpork.enabled
| `True`
| Deterimines whether Pulled Pork will be installed and configured for your IDS engine of choice (Suricata or Snort)

| included_components.logstash.enabled
| `True`
| Determines whether Logstash will be installed and configured for the data pipeline.

NOTE: I highly recommend leaving logstash even if you don't want the full ELK install. We've put a lot of work into processing the Bro logs with Logstash. If You'd like to split the data out to Splunk or some other SEIM, consider taking the feed after Logstash has processed it. See <<tuning, Tuning & Scaling>> for more discussion on options here.

| included_components.elasticsearch.enabled
| `True`
| Determines whether Elasticsearch will be installed and configured. See <<tuning, Tuning & Scaling>> for more discussion on options here.

| included_components.kibana.enabled
| `True`
| Determines whether Kibana will be installed and configured. See <<tuning, Tuning & Scaling>> for more discussion on options here.

| included_components.zookeeper.enabled
| `True`
| Determines whether Zookeeper will be installed and configured. See <<tuning, Tuning & Scaling>> for more discussion on options here.

*NOTE*: Zookeeper is required to run Kafka, so if you install Kafka you should leave this to true, or be willing to manually configure Kafka to point to another Zookeeper.

| included_components.kafka.enabled
| `True`
| Determines whether Kafka will be installed and configured. If `False`, the Bro configuration will be adjusted to disable Kafka logging.

| with_nginx
| `True`
| Determines whether Nginx will be installed and configured as the Kibana proxy. Nginx provides a control point that can provide for authentication enforcement to access Kibana.
